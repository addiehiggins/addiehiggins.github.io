## Welcome to my page!

This is where I maintain any of my open source work, for others to view, use, discuss, and compare. 

### About me

I'm currently a senior studying Electrical Engineering at Boise State University. 
Post-graduation, I'll be developing and prosecuting tech industry patents on behalf of professional engineers.
